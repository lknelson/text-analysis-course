    "## Introduction to Topic Modeling\n",
    "  \n",
    "Today we'll implement the most basic, and the original, topic modeling algorithm, LDA, using Python's scikit-learn. The other major topic modeling package is Gensim. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals\n",
    "* Implement a basic topic modeling algorithm and learn how to tweak it\n",
    "* Learn how to use different methods to calculate topic prevalence\n",
    "* Learn how to create some simple graphs with this output\n",
    "* Think though how and why you might use topic modeling in a text analysis project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "<ol start=\"0\">\n",
    "  <li>The Pandas Dataframe: Music Reviews</li>\n",
    "  <li>Fit an LDA Topic Model using scikit-learn</li>\n",
    "  <li>Document by Topic Distribution</li>\n",
    "  <li>Words Aligned with each Topic</li>\n",
    "  <li>Topic Prevalence</li>\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key Terms\n",
    "* *Topic Modeling*:\n",
    "    * A statistical model to uncover abstract topics within a text. It uses the co-occurrence fo words within documents, compared to their distribution across documents, to uncover these abstract themes. The output is a list of weighted words, which indicate the subject of each topic, and a weight distribution across topics for each document.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* *LDA*:\n",
    "    * Latent Dirichlet Allocation. A implementation of topic modeling that assumes a Dirichlet prior. It does not take document order into account, unlike other topic modeling algorithms.\n",
