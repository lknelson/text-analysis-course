       "[\"Well i'm not sure about the story nad it did seem biased. What\\nI disagree with is your statement that the U.S. Media is out to\\nruin Israels reputation. That is rediculous. The U.S. media is\\nthe most pro-israeli media in the world. Having lived in Europe\\nI realize that incidences such as the one described in the\\nletter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to\\nignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the\\nEuropeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think\\nthat might be a reason they report more clearly on the\\natrocities.\\n\\tWhat is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of\\nthe inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing\\nreceived from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt\\ngo away. After all, look how the Jews are treating other races\\nwhen they got power. It is unfortunate.\\n\",\n",

You might have to start asking the\\nsame sort of questions of Arab countries as well.

       " '\\n\\nI don\\'t know, but I\\'m as willing to speculate as anyone.\\n\\nSeveral people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography.\\nAnother possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other\\nalgorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on\\na session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something\\nlike DES) for the encryption.\\n\\nHow could the \"back door\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few\\npossibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that\\nthe session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door\\nkeys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers\\nused in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.\\n\\nAnother possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips\\nsimply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip\\'s own\\ninternal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys\\nusable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip\\'s\\nsecret key doesn\\'t need to be a public key in this usage, but can be\\nidentical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most\\nstraightforward to me.)\\n\\nStill another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the\\nmessage itself has a \"dual key\" property, that possession of either of\\ntwo keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from\\nthe DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised\\nduring her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and\\nDecember was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would\\nparticipate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn\\'t quite fit into\\nwhat we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early\\nknowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with\\nClipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.',\n",

When science\\ndiscovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that\\nMary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.\\n\\nMary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.

It is \\ndisingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich\\nor any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed \\nsolely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\\nIt seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem\\non the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,\\nand heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.\\nI will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of\\nwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information\\nwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the \\npeople in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily\\nbusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are\\nolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to\\nimagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \\nto view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\\nin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\\nSOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\nthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\nare back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\nan 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\nWe are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is \\nthe Israeli way of telling us that \"if you\\'re gonna hurt our soldiers\\nyou\\'re gonna pay the price\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay\\nto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting\\nthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather\\njust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young \\nmen to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are\\ntaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.\\nIsrael\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\nwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\\non the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \\nISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \\nleverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\\nThe people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a \\nregular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \\nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \\nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\\n\\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\nwould have resulted in.  \\nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \\nunilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusion\\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel\\'s \\npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \\nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \\npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \\naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\\n  \\n\\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\\n\\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\\n\\nYes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians.\\nThe real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave\\nIsraeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an \\noccupying soldier is attacked.\\n \\n',\n",

       " \"\\nOK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.\\n\\nWe all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why\\none can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,\\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\\nus who have bikes are familiar.\\n\\nLet's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \\na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \\nsurfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact \\npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \\nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \\nbut we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \\nbecause, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a \\nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch\\nforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.\\nYou'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\\nwas the rotation that did it.\\n\\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking\\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski\\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try\\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,\\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\\ncountersteering.\\n\\nConclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what\\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations\\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm \\nwilling to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. \\n\\nIf you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's\\nbehaviour is consistent with it.

I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive, \\nand am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on \\nit.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician \\nGold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by \\nhaving a device driver detect whenever more than one read is \\nnecessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it, \\nand minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard \\ndrive is notorious for bad sectors.

It gave me this \\nmessage twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program \\nand did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining \\nfor new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about \\nsectors for a brief period of time.\\n \\n        I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the \\nexact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the \\nsame error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went \\nto the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough \\nthere was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG, \\nbut removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors, \\neither audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the \\ncache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.\\n \\n        Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix \\nthem, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are \\nno errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other \\nfiles, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them \\nfor a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to \\ncompletely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through \\nthe c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.\\n \\n        Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on \\nmy hard drive?

They said, you \\nknow, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate \\nthe majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not \\nlike the -- it's not like the House.

It's very \\nsad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in \\na hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans \\nhad always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the \\nprogram were people like me who were out there at the grassroots \\nlevel, governors and senators.

The OAM is a small division of \\nthe NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 \\nbillion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available \\nresearch grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be \\navailable this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for \\nNatural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid \\nto become involved in AIDS.  \"They have to look successful and there is no \\neasy answer in AIDS,\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the \\nOAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, \\nsuch as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an \\nadvisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS \\ncommunity was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists\\' \\ngeneral lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic \\nwill be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \"The OAM advisory \\npanel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  \\nwill take them several years to accept the nature of research.\"   \\nNevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator \\nat the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \"Here is a \\nwonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.

Scientists previously knew that the natural \\nkiller cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso\\'s  \\nresearch represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural \\nkiller cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony \\nL. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube \\nfindings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the \\nbody.  Lusso\\'s  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  \\nmolecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface \\nreceptor, making them vulnerable to HIV\\'s attack.   Researchers concluded that \\nherpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV. \\n\\n    ======================================================================   \\n                                April 15, 1993 \\n     ====================================================================   \\n\\n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\" Journal of the \\nAmerican Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert, \\nGeorge and Nordenberg, Dale F.) \\n\\n     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only \\nensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health \\nproblems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert \\nand Dale F.

Dr. Berkley\\'s editorial on why American doctors  should care \\nabout the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for \\nthe concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should \\nbe noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it \\nis not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  \\nrespiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic \\ndevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  \\nBerkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have \\non many developing countries, and the increased need for international \\nassistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political \\naggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there \\nis a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach \\nto international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in \\nparticular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \"Earth in the \\nBalance\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable \\ninternational development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child \\nsurvival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the \\ndeveloping  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  \\nchange the future of worldwide health. \\n====================================================================   \\n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\" Journal of the American \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nMedical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth) \\n\\n     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible \\nbefore the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less \\nattention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller \\nFoundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and \\nNordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as \\nmalaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  \\neconomic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention \\nthan they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is \\nreceiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most \\ndeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic \\ndiseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another \\nyear  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS \\nand its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden \\nbut financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a \\nrampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each \\nindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley \\nsays he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  \\neconomic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he \\nconcludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the \\nUnited States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries \\nwith high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  \\nhas been the rule.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n\\n\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n                               AIDS/HIV Articles\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n\\n            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children\\n                                H H S   N E W S\\n     ********************************************************************\\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\\n                                March 29, 1993\\n\\n\\n        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children\\n\\n\\nThe National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental \\nHIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency \\nvirus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. \\n\\nThe trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 \\nchildren recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide.

Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \"a \\nhopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected \\nchildren who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\" \\n\\nAnthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and \\nInfectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \"is \\nthe first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay \\ndisease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\"  If these \\nvaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their \\ntherapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. \\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in \\nthe United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health \\nOrganization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. \\n\\nThe study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.

It will be several years, however, before researchers \\nknow how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. \\n\\nThe results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined \\nclosely for other reasons as well.  \"This trial will provide the first insight \\ninto how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\" said \\nDaniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID\\'s division of AIDS.  \"We need this \\ninformation to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent \\nHIV infection in children.\" \\n\\nIn the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city \\nareas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. \\n\\nNearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during \\npregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than \\na one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing \\nnumbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection \\ndrug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding \\nincrease in the numbers of infected children. \\n\\nHIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  \\nThe most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV \\ndevelop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These \\ninfections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of \\nchildhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms \\nleading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. \\n\\nAt least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger \\nto enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older \\nparticipants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no \\nsymptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen \\nliver or spleen.

Although the \\nHIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals\\' \\nimmunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV \\nitself caused the skin disease. \\n\\nOur findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease \\nwithout affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the \\nNational Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues \\ndescribed their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human \\nRetroviruses. \\n\\nDeveloping animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most \\nanimals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this \\nproblem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for \\nHIV as well as their own genetic material. \\n\\nNIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse \\neggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters \\ncontained both normal and transgenic animals. \\n\\nInstitute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV \\ngenetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon \\nafter birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an \\nincomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. \\n\\nSome of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their \\nnecks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin \\nlesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No \\nskin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. \\n\\nStudies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a \\ntype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can \\ncause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the \\nanimals. \\n\\nTissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the \\npresence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nEvidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \"turned \\non,\" or active, said Dr. Kopp. \\n\\nThe scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the \\nmice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common \\ninfections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals\\' immune \\nsystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the \\nskin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. \\n\\nFurther proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists \\nexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV \\ngenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  \\nPapilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the \\ngenes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No \\nlesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. \\n\\nThe transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter \\nDickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \\nDiseases. \\n\\nCollaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. \\nNickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; \\nDr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, \\nformerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 51\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS\\n                                H H S   N E W S\\n                 ********************************************\\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\\n\\n                                 March 4, 1993\\n\\n\\n     HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today announced the first nationwide \\nclinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care \\nprofessionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV \\ninfection or AIDS. \\n     The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a \\nphysician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on \\ndrugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is \\nfunded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of \\nSan Francisco General Hospital. \\n     Secretary Shalala said, \"One goal of this project is to share expertise \\nso patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health \\ncare providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces \\ntreatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and \\ncommunity social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients \\nwith HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\" \\n     Secretary Shalala said, \"This clinical expertise should be especially \\nhelpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in \\ncommunities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\" \\n     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and \\nit is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) \\nMonday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer \\nquestions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and \\nhealth care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be \\nanswered as quickly as possible. \\n     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question \\nrelated to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment \\ninformation, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, \\nliterature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health \\ncare professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate \\nsources of information or materials. \\n     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken \\nby either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse \\npractitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and \\ninpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant \\nasks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current \\nmedications, sex, age and the patient\\'s HIV history. \\n     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nresponded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern \\nCalifornia.  The initial project was funded by HRSA\\'s Bureau of Health \\nProfessions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and \\nby the American Academy of Family Physicians. \\n     \"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of \\ncare they are able to provide to their patients,\" said HRSA Administrator \\nRobert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  \"This project will be a great resource for \\nhealth care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve.\" \\n     \"This service has opened a new means of communication between health care \\nprofessionals and experts on HIV care management,\" said HRSA\\'s associate \\nadministrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources \\nDevelopment, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  \"Providers who treat people with \\nHIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment \\nmethods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS.\" \\n     HRSA is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within HHS.  \\n\\n\\n                      AIDS Hotline Numbers for Consumers\\n\\n                  CDC National AIDS Hotline -- 1-800-342-AIDS\\n                  for information in Spanish - 1-800-344-SIDA\\n          AIDS Clinical Trials (English & Spanish) -- 1-800-TRIALS-A\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 53\\n\\x0c\\n------------- cut here -----------------\\n-- This is the last part ---------------\\n',\n",

The system for the\\n   escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to\\n   encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.\\nBut DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now,\\nso the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break!\\n*At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they\\nneed to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search\\nfor the other 40-bit key.\\n\\nSimilarly, it didn\\'t say \"We\\'re making encryption is commercially available.\"\\nbecause encryption *is* already commercially available, including\\nforms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA.\\nAnd phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were\\nconvinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.\\n\\nThe next thing it didn\\'t say is \"We\\'re making encryption legal\",\\nbecause of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the\\nPresident can\\'t change the First Amendment merely by decree.\\nWhat it *did* say was:\\n\\tIn making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the\\n\\tprivate sector from developing, or the government from approving,\\n\\tother microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in\\n\\tassuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.\\nwhich clearly means \"We\\'re making encryption illegal unless we get your keys.\\nSoon.

Further, the Attorney General\\n   shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture\\n   Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.\\nwhich means \"We\\'ve got money Congress can\\'t control and we\\'re going to\\nbuy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO\\n(that\\'s what \"preserve the government\\'s ability to conduct ... surveillance\" \\nmeans.)

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent\\'s office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the \\'85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we\\'ll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it\\'s another story again - we\\'ll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens\\'t make sense.\"\\n \\n That\\'s what the book says.  We don\\'t insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone\\'s entitled to MY opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n======================================================================== 32\\n \\nI live in Idaho.

On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked\\nto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity\\nfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to\\n11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.\\n\\n3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss\\ntimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.

On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster\\nflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed\\nduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant\\nchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads\\n19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).

Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test\\nfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21\\n(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify\\nthe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller\\n(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement\\nfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry\\nrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry\\nSubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The\\n10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was\\nnot metering the data correctly.

Therefore, even if this\\nreligion does not take off, its founding members will be very important\\nhistorically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become \\ncommon.\\n\\nThe basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional\\nmorality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible\\'s\\naccounts of the facts and historical events is correct.\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\nStory of Adam and Eve:\\nAdam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.

The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will\\nprovide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it\\'s OK. This\\nis why married women usually didn\\'t work until recent decades.\\n2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler \\nand slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without \\nquestion by ordinary people, who can\\'t make decisions for themselves.\\n\\nInterpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:\\nThey were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God\\ntold them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were\\nobligated to do whatever their \"Father\" said to.  Being forced to leave the \\nGarden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.\\n\\nLessons from Traditional Interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.\\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is ideal.  Get-\\nting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.\\n3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.\\n4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and \\nshould do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for \\nthemselves.\\n5.

People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless\\nnamed \"Hillary Clinton\" or \"Murphy Brown\".\\n2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people \\n(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.\\n\\nInterpretation of events based on current philosophy:\\nThey were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge\\nrather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge\\nand (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-\\nselves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were \\nREWARDED by being allowed into the \"real world.\"\\n\\nLessons from new interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.\\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is at best\\na temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn\\nis ideal.\\n3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.\\n4.  Authority figures are often wrong.

Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a\\ncontrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of\\n\\n + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.\\n + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?\\n + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!\\n + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\\n\\nI am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and\\ncan perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as\\n\\n + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!\\n\\nThere are those who say that the definition of \"good\" is \"whatever\\nGod happens to want.\" But if that is so, then the statement that God\\nis good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.\\nThat being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He\\nis good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is\\npowerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he\\ntells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you\\ndefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes\\nsense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you\\ndon\\'t. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to\\nGenesis 18 and to Christianity in general.\\n\\nAny theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any\\nfurther discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)\\nmeaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements\\nare always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements\\nin particular cases about the course of action most likely to\\nachieve a good result.\\n\\nWhen I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in\\nhistory, those actions often seem to me very different from what I\\nmight expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.\\nMoreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural\\nworld, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might\\n\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of\\nthe Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort\\nof difficulties that they find in Nature.\")\\n\\nNow, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an\\nargument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.\\nOn the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose\\nthat I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every\\ntime he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \"Good move!\\nJust what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if\\nI were playing.\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a\\nchess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at\\nleast some of his moves will have me thinking, \"Now, what do suppose\\ninduced him to do that?\" or even, \"Boy, that was a real slip -- he\\'s\\njust thrown the game away!\" Similarly, if God understands the\\nworkings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that\\nsometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.\\n\\nOne difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the\\ncontrols of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess\\ngame. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was\\ncarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.\\nHowever, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a\\ntime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did\\nnot take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had\\nthought.\\n\\nWith God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total\\nresult of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging\\nthat I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier\\nthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.\\n\\n     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****\\n\\nIn the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph\\'s ten older brothers,\\nwho (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell\\nhim into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and\\nwhen there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his\\nfamily. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \"Do\\nnot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\"\\n\\n\\n        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events\\n   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued\\n   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,\\n   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews\\n   and of Judaism.\\n        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup\\n   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of\\n   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out\\n   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if\\n   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have\\n   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into\\n   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few\\n   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a\\n   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into\\n   the Promised Land.\\n        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered\\n   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,\\n   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of\\n   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would\\n   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.\\n   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of\\n   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the\\n   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility\\n   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human\\n   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never\\n   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.\\n   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the\\n   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.\\n        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming\\n   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only\\n   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem\\n   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,\\n   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place\\n   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the\\n   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in\\n   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,\\n   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the\\n   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish\\n   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge\\n   of all humans everywhere.\\n        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by\\n   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather\\n   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined\\n   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and\\n   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might\\n   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.\\n   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah\\n   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage\\n   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss\\n   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of\\n   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)\\n   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it\\n   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would\\n   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism\\n   saved them.\\n\\n        [Other examples here omitted for brevity\\'s sake.]\\n\\n        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became\\n   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR\\n   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,\\n   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on\\n   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the\\n   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast\\n   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she\\n   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she\\n   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.\\n   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney\\n   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for\\n   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking\\n   at Walt Disney, she said, \"And now, my special thanks to the\\n   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\" It was the most\\n   memorable line of the evening.\\n        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in\\n   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive\\n   to this day, beginning with Joseph\\'s brothers, and continuing\\n   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus\\n   Epiphanes....\\n\\nAfter the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him\\nprivately and said, \"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren\\'t\\nyou?\" He answered, \"If that is an example that came to your mind,\\nthen you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not\\ntalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\" I assume\\nthat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no\\nstate of Israel.\\n\\nSomeone hearing the rabbi\\'s lecture might leap to the conclusion\\nthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His\\npurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go\\non to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God\\'s doing -- that He\\nstirred up Joseph\\'s brothers to a murderous hate against him, and\\nthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh\\'s\\nheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.\\nAnd this raises questions about how an action can be considered\\nwicked and at the same time be considered something that God has\\nbrought about.\\n\\nI suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has\\na log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,\\ninstead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot\\nthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers\\nthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the\\nknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color\\nof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that\\nobservers will say: \"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a\\npiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its\\npresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a\\ngreat work of art.\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was\\nlooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not\\ncontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,\\nbut a different one. So, if Joseph\\'s brothers had not sold him, God\\nwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,\\nbut He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not\\nbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected\\nJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if\\nPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set\\nJesus free, it might appear that there would have been no\\nCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no\\nSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas\\' sin to redeem us. If\\nJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled\\nthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know\\nhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its\\ninterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and\\njust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth\\ngame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops\\nand had attacked Fisher\\'s knight instead (don\\'t bother to look up\\nthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is\\nnone the less valid).\\n\\nThus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of\\nPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice\\nwas not God\\'s doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God\\'s\\nplans by behaving justly and courageously.\\n\\nWhat, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \"I\\nwill harden Pharaoh\\'s heart, so that he will not let the people go\"?\\nSome Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet\\nwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty\\nwere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather\\nthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: \"If you see\\nthat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be\\ndiscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My\\npurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and\\nlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his\\nresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future\\nhistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have been\\nthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\"\\n\\nTo return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible\\nthat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are\\ninstruments of God\\'s will?\\n     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what\\nJoseph\\'s brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.\\nThey intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that\\ndoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation and\\npunishment.\\n     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not\\nthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had\\nrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder.

       " 'Hello src readers,\\n\\nAgain the misconception that Copts among other Oriental Orthodox\\nChurches believe in Monophysitism pops up again. We had a discussion\\nabout it a while ago. \\n\\n\\nThen OFM comments :\\n\\n\\nWith my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration\\nis needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\\n\\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\\nwas clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  These political motives\\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\\n\\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \"did not separate\\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\\n\\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn\\'t  quite go the\\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\\nEvangelical Churches.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\\nMonophysitism.\\n\\nPeace,\\n\\nNabil\\n\\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\\n    \\'-------------------------------------------------------------\\'\\n\\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\\nheretical probably aren\\'t.\\n\\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\\nrejected who didn\\'t intend heresy, but simply used language that was\\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\\nNestorians are not heretical either.

       " 'DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1]\\n\\n\\n          Born 1972\\n          Attended 9th Grade\\n          Middle School No. 17\\n\\n          Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25\\n          Microdistrict No. 3\\n          Sumgait [Azerbaijan]\\n\\nReally, people in town didn\\'t know what was happening on February 27. I came \\nhome from school at 12 o\\'clock, being excused to leave before the last period \\nin order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was \\nthe same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and \\nother things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first \\ncousin\\'s birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and \\non the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring \\nthat I\\'d have enough time to do my homework for the next day.\\n\\nWhen we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped \\nby a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. \\nThe driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus\\nbegins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to \\nthe doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking \\npassports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not \\ntaken for Armenians.\\n\\nWe set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old \\nbuilding where we knew there\\'d be a place to hide, but the whole road was \\npacked with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th \\nMicrodistrict. These groups were emptying people\\'s pockets and checking\\npassports. People who didn\\'t have passports with them were beaten as well.\\nThen we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning\\ncars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. \"Death to\\nthe Armenians\" was written on the cars.\\n\\nWhen we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still\\nquiet. We went on upstairs, but didn\\'t turn on any lights. We tried to call \\nBaku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. \\nThen there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to \\ncome down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us\\nto the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you \\nenter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was \\nbeaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors\\' daughter said that that\\'s right, \\nthat\\'s what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people \\nwere being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn\\'t stay very \\nlong in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, \\nlooking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said \\nthings now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a\\ncar on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that \\nthey be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that \\nthere weren\\'t any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of \\nthe building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later \\nfound out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri\\nAvakian was killed, too.\\n\\nWhen the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go \\nhome. We went back up to our place and again didn\\'t turn on the light. We \\nstarted to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We\\ntried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We\\ndecided she had already left.\\n\\nWe sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my\\nfather. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father\\'s\\nwork brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our\\ntown. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get\\nout of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn\\'t want to give him our address,\\nbut my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the\\ncall a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke\\ndown the door and came into the apartment . . .\\n\\nThey came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians \\nwere. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we \\ncould do. One of them took my parents\\' passports and began to read them. He \\nread the surname \"Danielian,\" turned the page, read \"Armenian,\" and that alone\\nwas enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the \\ncourtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, \\npushed some of the keys on the piano and said \"your death has tolled.\" They \\nhad knives and steel truncheons.\\n\\nI had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t use it. I just knew that if\\nI didn\\'t give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents \\nand said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded\\nthat we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken \\noutdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to\\npush her so she\\'d walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind \\nher. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began \\nbeating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.\\n\\nWe are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their \\nbalconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they \\nstrike me, and I\\'m knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I \\nlose consciousness often . . . I don\\'t see or hear my parents, since I was the\\nfirst one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are\\nlying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from \\ntheir balconies. That\\'s it. I try to pick them up, but can\\'t. My left arm is \\nbroken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an \\nambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.\\n\\nWe were attacked at around 9 o\\'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and \\ntry to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors\\' door, \\nthey push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our \\nneighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she\\nsends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the \\nwindow to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can\\'t see very far as a \\nresult of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken \\naway. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken \\naway, and everything will be OK.\\n\\nBut they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the\\nambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received\\nattention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 \\no\\'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with \\nsome \"assistants.\" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, \\nand I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds\\non my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o\\'clock I and the other Armenians who are \\nin the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.\\n\\nIn my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them\\nArmenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only\\nAzerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,\\nbefore the 27th.\\n\\nThen I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was \\nreleased, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first \\nthey told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out \\nthat they were dead. My father\\'s older brother told me.\\n\\nMy father\\'s name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My \\nmother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the \\nleader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.\\n\\nThey were also beaten on the head. The coroner\\'s report stated that their\\nheads were smashed open and bled profusely.\\n\\nAt the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out \\nlater, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called \\nspecifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address \\nand dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn\\'t know the address.\\nBefore the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the \\nphone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He \\ndenies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father \\nanswered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he \\ncalled from home, which also isn\\'t true. I heard noise and the sounds of \\nautomobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had \\nnever served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 \\nyears old. I don\\'t know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he \\nwas the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.\\n\\nMy parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was \\ntwo years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to\\ngo to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He\\nwent off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural \\nprojects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and \\nlater moved to Sumgait, helping with the town\\'s construction. Mamma was from \\nthe village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in \\na bookstore, and later, on a construction site.\\n\\n\\nMy sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I\\nalways loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it\\nwas their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and\\nwanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military\\nSchool. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-\\nsider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join \\nthe Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life\\nlong--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it\\nmore than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,\\nand he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.\\n\\nNow I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home \\nof my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.\\n\\nWhile in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had\\nsuffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at\\ntheir residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long\\ntime, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I\\nalso learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped\\n\\n. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,\\nabout a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with\\nhis parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and\\nhis parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even\\ncame to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But\\nin the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of\\nothers, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .\\n\\nToday Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,\\nwas shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to \\nrecognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.\\nI was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision\\nof the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of \\nArmenia.\\n\\nAfter the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give\\nKarabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live\\npeacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they\\ncan do that.\\n\\nI arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.\\nAfter a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I \\nthink that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.\\n\\nYou can\\'t take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno\\nKarabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had \\neven decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move \\nhere for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and \\nthat what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was\\nwrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct \\na mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies \\nin the hands of our government.\\n\\nJune 13,1988\\n\\nStepanakert \\n',\n",

Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians\\nintent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The\\nbalancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.\\n\\n\\n\\tThat seems to be the case already, given that heavy\\nweapons aren\\'t commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low\\nnumbers, obviously due to cost, I don\\'t think the superior\\nweapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically\\nsuperior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training\\nincludes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,\\nwhereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.\\n\\n\\n\\tI had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers\\nof a select group, and the like would exercise control over the\\nheavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman\\ntank I certainly wouldn\\'t ask him to give it up.  Follow orders\\nfrom the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large,\\nthough, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should\\ntherefore be jointly maintained and operated.\\n\\n\\n\\tThis I\\'ll agree with to a point.  The State having control\\nover the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state\\nto have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that\\nthe ability of the State to lock them up isn\\'t so easy.  Otherwise,\\nI would have to assume that State control would rest on the\\nauthority of the Governor and militia officers.\\n\\n\\n\\tI\\'m having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,\\nfairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few\\npeople with government support.  Just as you argued above that\\nthe weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control\\nso one side doesn\\'t have all of them, I can\\'t see where this\\nsituation is alleviated in having the select militia holding\\nall the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.\\nI think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that\\nthe Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the\\nunorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.\\n\\n\\n\\tWe have to assume that there would be those who would\\nside with the government-controlled forces, and if they\\'ve all\\nthe equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble.\\nI\\'d like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the\\nlocal troups having a few 105\\'s and anti-tank weapons in their\\narmory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the\\ntank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.\\nI suppose I\\'m quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.\\n\\n\\n\\tSo would I, but the resources often aren\\'t available to\\noutfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to\\ncall in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster\\nthan anything else.\\n\\n\\n\\tPerhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think\\nmain battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up\\nfield pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton\\ntrucks, HumVee\\'s, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff\\nof a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units\\nin Iowa are currently fielding in some units.\\n\\n\\tPerhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy\\nequipment under State control, with little but numbers and light\\nstuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the\\nstates should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local\\nranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,\\nhence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,\\nthe militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for\\nother responses.  The Federal army, I\\'m convinced, should have a\\nvery minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias\\nfor these functions.',\n",

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\\n\\n\\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\\n    scintillation proportional counters.\\n\\n\\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\\'s atmosphere,\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\\'s\\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\n\\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through Titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\n\\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\\n    Saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\\n    nature of Saturn\\'s rings.\\n\\n\\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\\n\\t -------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\\n\\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\\n\\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\\n\\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\\n\\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\\n\\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\\n\\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\\n\\n\\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\\n\\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter\\'s north pole in a gravity-assist\\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\\'s south pole\\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\\n    that\\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\\n\\n    While in Jupiter\\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\\n    radiation environment.

Let me preface it by\\nsaying that I largely agree that the \"Space Age\" in the romantic sense\\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \"What\\'s New\" -\\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it\\'s clear that the\\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \"mind\\nchildren\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\\nwhat we can do *now*.   \\n\\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\\n\\n\\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\\n\\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\\n\\nAt 35, America\\'s Space Age won\\'t have to suffer through the angst of a\\nmidlife crisis.\\n\\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\\nrewards.  \\n\\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America\\'s science\\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\\npolicy.  \\n\\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\\nto build space station Freedom alone.\\n\\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\\n\\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\\nspace budgets.\\n\\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \\n\\n......\\n\\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America\\'s\\ntechnological prowess.

For\\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\\n\\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\\nfrom past masters.\\n\\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\\n\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\" \\nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\\'ve made us mad!  What are these\\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\\n\\n     Well I\\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\\n\"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\\nless than many billions of dollars.\\n\\n     It took some of the last generation\\'s experts to teach us\\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\\'s first rocket was not a\\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\\'s ICBM\\'s didn\\'t take ten years to\\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\\'t cost $1 billion.\\n\\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\\'s to remind\\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\\'s. \\nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\\nlittle, Test a little.\\n\\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\\ndidn\\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\\'d just change\\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\\nknown as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn\\'t spend a\\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\\'s the\\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\\'t\\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\\nthreat that he\\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\\nit ran over cost or schedule.\\n\\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\\'t keep in mind its\\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\\nbudget.\\n\\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\\n(See charts)\\n\\n     I\\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\\'s\\nand 1960\\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\\ncan\\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\\n\\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\\n\\n     I say to you -- we\\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\\nbring your view-graphs, and I\\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.

And, again, the mating\\npractices need to be reexamined...\\n\\n\\nNo, but mating practices are a special case.  I\\'ll have to think about it\\nsome more.\\n\\n\\nIndeed.

       " \"After reading the debate over the Clipper, I have a few things to\\nadd.\\n\\n\\tFirst, most of the people I know who activly use encryption\\nprivately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate,\\nand any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the US. All they\\ncare about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,\\nafter all IS the bottom line. \\n\\n\\tSecond, if I look at all the people I know who use any form\\nof encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who\\nstill insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people \\nlooking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think\\nof anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves\\ntheir methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make\\nmistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are\\njust as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. \\n\\n\\tThird, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly\\nfamiliar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption\\nstratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that\\nsomeone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.\\nThat despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can \\nnot see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.\\n\\n\\tFourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid\\npeople out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the \\nbuilt in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to\\ndo any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going\\nto run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start\\nlooking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. \\n\\n\\n\\tIf nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,\\nthe truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into\\nsimply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything\\nelse. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do\\nnot think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be\\nslowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to \\nconvert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,\\nthe Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.\\n\\n\\n\\tThe bottom line here is that people will use what works, and\\nunavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption\\nrelated charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty\\ncharges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.\\n\\tThe other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide \\nuseage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is\\nout of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box\\nhas been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindness\\nto this that I've found utterly stunning, and the Clipper Chip, along\\nwith the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger\\ndegree.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tSincerly,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tTim Scanlon\\n\\n-- \",\n",

I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read\\nit in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but\\nharder to install.  Is there really a big difference?\\n\\nIt has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a\\nsensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn\\'t paying real close attention I\\nmight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which\\nwould wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned \\nthe thing off.  I\\'m pretty coordinated, so this doesn\\'t bother me, if it\\nwere for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I\\'m ok with it.\\n\\nThe installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal\\nand a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal\\nfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I\\'m\\nnot sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what\\nexactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get\\nit?\\n\\nI think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative\\nside tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and\\nall that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:\\n\\n\\t1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a\\n\\t    device?\\n\\t2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?\\n\\t3.  Are \"professionally\" installed CCs signifacantly better and\\n\\t    worth the cabbage?\\n\\t4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just\\n\\t    that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple \\n\\t    needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,\\n\\t    the questions above)?\\n\\nMy father and I built a \"Veep\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in\\nhigh school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and\\ncars.  So the installation doesn\\'t scare me.  I just want to be certain that\\nI get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more\\ncomplicated than my Veep. :-)\\n\\nI appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any\\nexpertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.

But these were\\nmiracles of our parent\\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\\nhave told us - \"you\\'ve lost it!\"  The \"me\" generation is only\\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\\n\\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team\\'s work - and yes struggle\\n- to build this nation\\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\\n\\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\\nSchriever\\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\\n\\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \\nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\\'ve listened\\nto your stories.  We\\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \\nAnd we\\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\\ninto today\\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\\n\\n     You told us in the 60\\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a\\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\\naviation in the 1920\\'s and 30\\'s - build a little and test a little\\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\\nstarted this program for the SDI.\\n\\n     Douglas Aircraft didn\\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\\'t even\\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn\\'t take a decade or more\\nbefore putting the first \"rubber on the road.\"  Max Hunter - you\\ndidn\\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\\'re not going to\\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\\naerospace transportation is real.\\n\\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\\nrelationship.\\n\\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\\n\\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\\nyes - we\\'ll make a little money off it too!\\n\\n     Then - and only then - we\\'ll spend another three years to\\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \\nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind\\'s next step to the stars!\\n\\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard\\'s first rockets weren\\'t Saturn\\nV\\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at\\nhand!',\n",

I just don't understand why people insist\\non lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium).\\nMost batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have\\nthe platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters.\\nI guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams\\nmay be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probably\\nonly a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters\\nfor this reason during the regular season.\\n\\nI think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of\\nwhether they are lefties or righties.

       " \"Sorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...\\n\\nI'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I\\ncan help a little.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

       " \"Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and\\nrelated topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can \\npredict a player's RBIs using information about his overall\\nperformance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP)\\nthat he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated\\npredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This \\ncompletely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 \\ncould do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd\\ntake that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to\\nthe data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.\\n\\nI've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that\\nI've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and\\nb) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits.\\nThat gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.

The latter was written with\\n    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind\\n    (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).\\n\\n    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John\\n    Snyder\\'s USGS publication \"Map Projections--A Working Manual\", USGS\\n    Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32\\n    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both\\n    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It\\'s a\\n    neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one\\'s $20.\\n\\n    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,\\n    \"An Album of Map Projections\", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This\\n    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are\\n    in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.\\n\\n    You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:\\n    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National\\n    Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and\\n    tell you where to send your money.

Is it\\npolitically correct for Christians to be the only besieged group\\npermitted the luxury of arrogance?   \\n\\nNow I have a question for Bob.  Why in the world would any self-respecting\\natheist want to subscribe to a Christian news group?  I have a \\ndifficult enough time keeping up with it, and I think I know something\\nabout the subject.     \\n\\nBob reminds me of my roommate.  In order to disbelieve atheism, he says \\nhe will need to be proven wrong about it.  Well, I don\\'t even waste \\nmy time trying.  I tell him that he\\'ll just have to take my word for it. \\nIn response, he tells me he will say an \"atheist\\'s prayer\" for me. \\n\\nGood luck, Bob.  And, best regards.\\n  ',\n",

       " ': From: shirriff@sprite.berkeley.edu (Ken Shirriff)\\n: Message-ID: <1r24us$oeh@agate.berkeley.edu>\\n: It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications\\n: would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future\\n: probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.\\n\\nI think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court.\\nCurrently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record\\ncalls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants\\nand listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this\\nstrategy wouldn\\'t get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not\\nin the near term.)\\n\\nIn other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence\\ninadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to\\ninterpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I\\'d be surprised\\nthat archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything\\nbut analogous to a wiretap by the courts.\\n\\nNote that that doesn\\'t mean I think it won\\'t be done if technically\\nfeasible.  Just as I\\'m sure many wiretaps are done now without\\nwarrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future,\\nstart surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause,\\ndecrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation\\ngets a boost from data that, sadly, won\\'t ever be presented to a jury.\\n\\nWhile I\\'m posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this\\narchiving scenario to extremes, read \"Lacey and his Friends\", a\\ncollection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the\\nslippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don\\'t worry folks, it\\'s\\nstored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can\\nget to it.  And by the way, we\\'ll be installing cameras on all major\\nstreets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and\\nteller machines, don\\'t we?\\n\\nAnd then we\\'ll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public\\nplaces.  Then in some private places.  Then we\\'ll make it a crime ever\\nto be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy\\ncubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and\\nafter.  But, see, there\\'s still a right to privacy.  We haven\\'t\\ncurtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it\\'d\\nbe to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a\\nVR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.\\n\\nAnd hey, nobody\\'ll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.\\n\\nAfter all, if you\\'re not doing anything illegal...\\n\\nFunny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became\\npretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn\\'t elminate all\\ncrime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds\\nof national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their\\nexecs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of\\ncompetition.  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system.  \\nI can\\'t imagine why.\\n',\n",

       " 'You are making the same mistake I did: you are confusing the DRIVE\\ninterface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface.  Again from my Mac & IBM info\\nsheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the\\ninfo-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}:\\nExpansion\\nBoth Mac & IBM\\nSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.\\n Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card \\n expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some \\n specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller \\n specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.  \\n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \\n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \\n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the \\n end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \\nSCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a\\n SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2\\n which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}.\\nSCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully\\n SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it \\n needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be \\n very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst \\n {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\\n {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and\\n reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between\\n SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.\\n\\nIBM\\nHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:\\n[...]\\nIDE:  Integrated Device Electronics \\n currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized \\n drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.\\n\\nSo at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES \\nthe through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode\\nit blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can.\\nThe problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put\\nrates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT\\nthe interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the\\nSCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling\\nprophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which\\nin turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its\\ncost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the\\nRule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt\\nthe cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}',\n",

These young men are\\n   supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\n   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\n   for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\n   by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\n   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\n   are back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\n   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\n\\nSome of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you\\ndescribe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area,\\nbacked by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah\\nand Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation,\\nwhile mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate\\nbombing, which would have produced major casualties.\\n\\n   Israel\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\n   we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\\n   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \\n   ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \\n   leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\\n\\nWell, here we disagree.

In fact it has caused much more\\n   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\n   would have resulted in.  \\n\\nActually that is not clear at all.

       " '\\nThe existence of repeated earth lives and destiny (karma) does not\\nmean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds.\\nThere is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction, but I\\ndid not subscribe to that view.  God may choose one individual over\\nanother as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not\\npreclude that the development of that individual into what he is in\\nthis earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.\\n\\nI do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view\\nof an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that\\nbefalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater\\nlaw in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the\\nultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of\\nChrist can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that\\nwas completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the\\nflesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental\\nconcepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized\\nand mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus\\nChrist to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.\\nTheir teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the\\ncontinuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism).\\nMore important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,\\nthe ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate\\nresurrection and judgement on the Last Day.\\n\\nThere is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the\\ntenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.\\nClearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma\\nor that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a\\nnew impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not\\nrefute the disciples\\' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of\\ncourse, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only\\none of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man\\nhimself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his\\nparents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at\\nall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of\\nChrist\\'s answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.\\n\\nThere is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John\\nthe Baptist,\\n\\n   \"If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.\"\\n\\nThis also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching\\neither way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to\\nthe human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did\\nnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (\"If\\nyou care to accept it\").  So I took care to point out, not that the\\nBible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and\\nthat much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes\\nunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I\\npointedly used \"repeated earth lives\" to distinguish a little from the\\noriental doctrines usually associated with the word \"reincarnation\".\\nThe phrase is Rudolf Steiner\\'s (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too\\nthat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely\\nfree from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth\\ncenturies, the most important expression of it being Lessing\\'s \"The\\nEducation of the Human Race\".\\n\\nTo return to your original point, Paul\\'s statement about Jacob and\\nEsau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.\\nAnd both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the\\nincarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus\\nChrist, in my view.',\n",

What if my boss comes in to ask\\nme some kind of question, I don\\'t know the answer so I take a military\\nspecification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out\\nfalls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?

Pretty words from the company\\ndo me no good when I\\'m terrified or healing from the latest assault.)\\n\\nAnd please pray that I don\\'t turn into an automaton because of this.\\nThat\\'s my bad habit: \"ignore it and it will go away\", \"you\\'re not worth\\nanyone\\'s time so don\\'t go talking to anyone about this\", \"you\\'re right,\\nyou are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this\\nway\", \"you are just an object\", \"you prostitute your mind to this\\ncompany so why can\\'t others expect you to prostitute your body there as\\nwell?\", \"what makes you think women aren\\'t just possessions, and\\nnothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\"\\nThis is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major\\ndepressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don\\'t come into\\nmy head and stay there, triggering depression.\\n\\nPlease pray that this latest trauma doesn\\'t come between me and God.\\nIn a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to\\nGod, and it\\'s also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can\\nseparate one mentally from God.

Sophisticated\\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\\ninnovative approaches.\\n\\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\\n\\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\\n\\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\\n\\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\\nescrow system.\\n\\nKEY-ESCROW\\n\\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\\ncommunications.\\n\\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\\n\\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.

So this objection is a red\\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \\nthe histories I\\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \\nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\\nis possible that the histories I\\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\\nit - would it be in Hitler\\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \\n\\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \\nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \\nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \\nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \\nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \\n1920\\'s.\\n\\n\\nAh, yes.

Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \\nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\\'ve read), I\\'d like to know \\nwhat tainted \"evidence\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \\nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \\naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \\n1920\\'s and 30\\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \\ntime and plant \"tainted\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \\nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \\nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \\nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \\nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \\nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \\nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \\nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\\n\\n\\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \\n\\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \\nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject.

I\\nthink a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.\\n\\nAnyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for\\npicnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a\\ncouple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an\\nefficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my\\ncar battery in about half an hour).\\n\\nUnfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic\\nspecs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the\\ntemperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably\\nits power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we\\nhave a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no\\nleakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the\\ntwo sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more\\n(although that would be a lousy way to control it).\\n\\nWhat I would like to know is:\\n\\n1: Are the above guesses correct?\\n\\n2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?\\n   (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm\\n   too fast when I unplug it)\\n\\n3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?  It looks like\\n   magic!\\n\\n4: Why don't they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers?\\n\\n\\nThanks in advance,\\n\\nPaul.\",\n",

       " '\\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade\\n\\nMAGI: \\n\\n[Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\n ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\n most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\n second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\\n\\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \\netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \\nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \\n(Gershevitch, 1964).\\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\\nhierarchy.\\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\\nof Central Asia.\\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\\nthat of the priesthood: white.\\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\\nmaster of himself.\\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\\npriesthood, would be very strange.\\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra\\'s treachings, as well as in\\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.',\n",

Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\\n\\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\\n\\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\\n\\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make\\nsense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the\\ncross, would want to share in his death.\",\n",

The 27th was a short day at\\nwork, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided\\nto go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal\\nFlame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had\\nwalked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes\\nbehind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24\\nVolga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the \\ncar. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,\\nand the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn\\'t have anything on her head, and \\nher hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They\\'re 40 to \\n45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help\\nthem. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?\\n\\nWhen I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn\\'t see what it was, \\nbut it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the \\nEternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle\\naround it. I ask, \"What\\'s going on?\" Someone tells me, \"Come listen.\" Well\\nthey were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \"Brother\\nMuslims, our time has come . . . \" and something else along that line. I\\ndidn\\'t understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to \\nget a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. \\nNew people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And\\nthe comments started: \"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\" and \"There\\'s\\nno need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\" I even heard that: \"All \\nMoscow is behind us.\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this \\nwas no joke. I quietly left and went home.\\n\\nNow before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh, \\nthat there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of \\nthings, but I didn\\'t have any idea what was really going on.\\n\\nMy wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt\\'s house in Baku. \\nI didn\\'t say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two\\no\\'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and \\nshouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,\\nlike they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a \\ndemonstration and move slowly.\\n\\nMy wife asks what\\'s going on out there. I say I don\\'t know. I put on some\\noutdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd\\npeople are shouting \"Down with the Armenians!\" and \"Death to the Armenians!\" I\\nwaited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street \\non the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned \\nand went against the traffic--it\\'s one way there--down the Street of the 26 \\nBaku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there \\nwas a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same \\nkind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside \\nfrom the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young\\npeople in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.\\n\\nMy wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of\\nuneasy and said, \"No, let\\'s stay at home instead.\" An hour went by, or maybe \\nan hour and a half. Well, I wasn\\'t keeping track of the time, I can\\'t say\\nexactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on\\nthe side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.\\n\\nI put outside clothes on and went out again. There\\'s noise, an uproar outside,\\nand the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time \\nthere were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more \\naggressive. No, I think, something\\'s wrong here, this isn\\'t any demonstration.\\nThey would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run \\nagain. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I \\nfollowed them. I was thinking I\\'d just watch and see. Who knew where this was \\nleading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one \\nside, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square \\nand heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There \\nwas some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.\\nI heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \"We don\\'t need \\nperestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\" Now what did they \\nmean by \"living like we have been?\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. \\nBut too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense \\nof others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just \\nin Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I\\'ve never seen it \\nanywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.\\n\\nNow at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians\\' \\napartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn\\'t \\nhear them say \"kill them\" over the microphone, I only heard \"beat them and \\ndrive them out.\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then\\nanother are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off\\nto the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and \\nI think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.\\nThere were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn\\'t see any of them try \\nto pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.\\n\\nWell I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no\\ndemonstration, and I had to protect my family.\\n\\nI left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next\\nto the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-\\nlor\\'s shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-\\nthing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because\\nafter all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons\\nin there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City \\nParty Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I \\nsaw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the \\ncases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 \\nto 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried \\noff by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing\\nright next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe \\nabout the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. \\nWhen I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was \\nabout a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He \\nhas a package in his hand, and he\\'s pulling out anasha and handing it out. I \\nhave never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I\\'ve seen a lot of \\npeople smoke it, I\\'ve seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled \\naround and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.\\n\\nBefore I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. \\nI turned around and saw them running. Well I\\'ll just keep on going like I am, \\nI thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. \\nAnd I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the \\nstreet. He\\'s a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, \\nwhich had \"Ermeni oryum\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \"Death to \\nArmenians!\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don\\'t really\\nknow what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father\\'s name is\\nRafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark\\nblue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His \\nfamily, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on \\nNarimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; \\ntheir apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the \\nleft. Now Rafik\\'s little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a \\nnew apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son \\nwas carrying a flag that said \"Death to Armenians!\" I was surprised because \\nbefore this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being \\ndone not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.\\n\\nWell anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \"It\\'s OK, it\\'ll pass, \\nthey\\'re young kids, they\\'ve just gotten all whooped up.\" Naturally I didn\\'t \\nwant her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And \\nthis time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn\\'t \\nsee where. Well I think, here we go, the machine\\'s in motion. They weren\\'t \\nhanding out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn\\'t see people drinking \\nand smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn\\'t unloaded the vodka and \\nhashish to put in a store window!\\n\\nSo the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one \\nwould stop them now, they weren\\'t even trying, although, I\\'ll say it again, \\nthe police were there, I saw them. And it\\'s not just that the police weren\\'t \\nbreaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. \\nTrue, at the time I couldn\\'t even imagine that under our government, our much-\\nvaunted leadership--and I\\'m not afraid to say these words: so many people \\ndied, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I \\ncouldn\\'t imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be \\nspecific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of \\nSumgait, I couldn\\'t imagine that such things could take place.\\n\\nWhen they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \"Let\\'s go upstairs.\" \\nWe went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the \\nevening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.\\nI stopped at \"The Corner,\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I \\nlook and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to \\nthe bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. \\nThe crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed \\ntoward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, \\nwheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as \\nthough it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more \\nnoise, and the glass was flying again.\\n\\nWe spent the night at the neighbors\\'. My apartment was on the first floor,\\nthere was really no way to defend yourself there.\\n\\nIn the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. \\nOn the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or \\nwhat happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the \\nbread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying \\nthere hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing\\nyou couldn\\'t even see him.\\n\\nThat was on the morning of February 28.

Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\\nindeed \"chorion.\" \\n\\nNow I\\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\\n\\n\\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \\n\\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\\n\\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \\nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \\nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \\nthink it more likely that Mr Archer\\'s investigations into \"contradictions\" to \\nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \\nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \\nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\\nto support Mr Archer\\'s contentions). \\n\\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\\'s) is the definition of\\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\\nBullinger\\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\\nadmit how stupid Bullinger\\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\\nwhich drives the point home). \\n\\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \\nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \\nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\\ndiscussing the \"Potter\\'s Field.\"\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler',\n",

Is it the sort of\\nthing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with no\\nchance of it being circulated?

To come up\\nto speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for by\\npersonality type summary file.\\n\\nOne observation is that people have significantly different personalities\\n(no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect\\nto church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while\\nother people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more\\nsolitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if\\nconfronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of\\npeople.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.\\n\\nMy impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and\\ncreate environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted\\n(there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am\\nquite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches\\nto participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very\\nuncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly\\ninfluenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing.\\n(BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both\\npreferences have their place in the Body).\\n\\nMaybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words\\nare usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert\\nscale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is\\nexcerpted from my summary:\\n\\n1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:\\n\\n        Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside\\n                          world of people, activities or things.\\n\\n        Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal\\n                          world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.\\n\\n\\nHopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can\\nstructure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise\\nthe Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities\\nto fit them into a particular framework.

Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.',\n",

       " 'Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts!\\n\\n BACKGROUND\\n ----------\\n\\n The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions \\n devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad \\n interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, \\n roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,\\n motosports enthusiasts.\\n\\n The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little\\n over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from\\n New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada\\n Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.\\n\\n The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need \\n to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of \\n performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise \\n ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.\\n\\n Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to \\n issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \"flame-free\".  \\n\\n HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION\\n ---------------------------------\\n\\n You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:\\n\\n\\n        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\\n\\n\\n Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day\\n (depending on the topic). \\n\\n   NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the\\n       list directly.\\n \\n After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive\\n an RSVP request.

Occasionally,\\n sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of\\n employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive\\n bounces from the race list.

It shouldn\\'t have, but\\nit did.\"\\n\\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game\\'s end.\\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They\\'ll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\\nChicago Stadium.\\n\\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\\n\\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\\n\\n``It\\'s a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we\\'d have kept working, it would have\\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\\n\\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\\n``We won, and that\\'s all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\\n\\nSome players didn\\'t have a problem.\\n\\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn\\'t quit,\" said Rich\\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\\ncan\\'t allow five goals like we did, that\\'s not right.\\n\\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\"\\n\\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues\\' effort. Somehow,\\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota\\'s loss.\\n\\n``I didn\\'t know it was final,\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\\nbench. I didn\\'t realize it was a final for some reason. We\\'re in the playoffs,\\nand that\\'s great, but it\\'s a little disappointing to play like we did at the\\nend.\"\\n\\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\\n\\n``I told them I didn\\'t want to see the score, I didn\\'t want to know the score,\"\\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that\\'s the approach we took.\"\\n\\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\\n\\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\\n\\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\\n\\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\\n\\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \\nrebound of Bret Hedican\\'s shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\\n\\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\\n\\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He\\'s in heaven now, and\\nI know he was watching. I know he\\'s happy.\"\\n\\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph\\'s shutout just 18 seconds\\nlater, making it 5-1.\\n\\nLess than a minute after the North Stars\\' final was announced, Tim Bergland\\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\\n\\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\\nperiod.\\n\\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan\\'s second goal stand up as the\\nwinner. ``We were in there,\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\"',\n",

As I mentioned in the Tradition\\n# cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory\\n# about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the \"evil\"\\n# which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as \"satanic.\"\\n\\n     Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is\\n     metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not\\n     the same way?\\n\\n# The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane\\n# in human language is something like describing \"color\" to a person\\n# who has been blind from birth.  You may want to read the book\\n# FLATLAND (if you haven\\'t already) or THE DRAGON\\'S EGG.  The first\\n# is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con-\\n# cept...\\n\\n[some deleted for space saving]\\n\\n# When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe\\n# another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then\\n# such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be\\n# necessary.

But, like all models, a compro-\\n# mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness\\n# of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all\\n# crippled.  But what else can you do?\\n\\n     This is why I asked the above.  How would you then\\n     know God exists as a spirit or being rather than\\n     just being metaphorical?  I mean, it\\'s okay to say\\n     \"well, Satan is just metaphorical,\" but then you\\n     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is\\n     not some metaphor for something else.\\n\\n     I say this because there are many, many instances of\\n     Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in \\n     the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the\\n     New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is\\n     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know\\n     one is metaphorical and not the other.\\n\\n     Further, belief in God isn\\'t a bar to evil.  Let\\'s\\n     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were\\n     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe\\n     in God to justify this belief.

For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.

       " 'Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for\\nWindows 3.1.  I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia\\'s\\nMS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some\\nsites in the U.S.  The three I found were:\\n\\n1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)\\n                                This was the smallest and simplest\\n   of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.\\n   It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra\\n   button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the\\n   title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press\\n   a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would\\n   have been nice if there was an \"ALWAYS ON TOP\" setting for the little\\n   window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified\\n   strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be\\n   a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace\\n   manager makes it an attractive package.\\n\\n2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)\\n                               While this workspace manager offered a\\n   few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming\\n   to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace\\n   is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take \"snapshots\"\\n   of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what \\n   applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,\\n   but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.\\n   With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in\\n   a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this\\n   viewing functionality which is quite useful.\\n\\n3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)\\n                            This is an interesting package, which contains\\n   a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies\\n   include \"Backmenu\", which provides a pop-up root menu when you\\n   press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu\\n   is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,\\n   which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could\\n   say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also\\n   bundled in \"backdesk.zip\" is a program called \"WRUN\", which allows\\n   you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS\\n   instead of using the File Manager to run applications.  \\n   The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite\\n   differently to the other two workspace managers in that it\\n   doesn\\'t provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.\\n   In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,\\n   and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to\\n   focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different\\n   viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which\\n   each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window\\n   allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically\\n   the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area\\n   while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up\\n   of a particular section.',\n",

Ville Siren\\'s slap\\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \\n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn\\'t see the puck since\\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \\n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer\\'s goal\\'s far side.\\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\\n game\\'s final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\\n\\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn\\'t the best.\\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\\n to try no combinations.\\n\\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\\n Stillman good on defense.\\n Some players aren\\'t good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\\n\\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn\\'t have a very good game, we\\'ve seen him\\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland\\'s starting goalie in the WC.\\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-\\n resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.\\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n Starting lines:\\n\\n \\tSWEDEN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFINLAND\\n\\n  35.

What is XFree86?\\n\\n   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with\\n   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and\\n   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:\\n\\n    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,\\n       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require\\n       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of\\n       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by\\n       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield\\n       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.\\n    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default\\n       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now\\n       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately\\n       20% faster than X386 1.2.\\n    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,\\n       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4\\n       with the \\'Advanced Compatibility Package\\', local connections from\\n       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.\\n    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.\\n       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about\\n       the ATI and Trident drivers.\\n    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt\\'s\\n       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).\\n    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is\\n       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the\\n       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.\\n    7) New configuration method which allows the server\\'s drivers and font\\n       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary\\n       distributions.\\n    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.\\n    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA\\n       cards is now included.\\n\\n   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2\\n   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):\\n\\n    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of\\n       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 \\n       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).\\n    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the\\n       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \"two\\n       headed\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only\\n       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).\\n    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.\\n    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to\\n       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for\\n       more information.)\\n    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some \\n       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).\\n    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor\\n       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous\\n       documentation and a lot of experimentation).\\n    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including\\n       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many \\n       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more \\n       information).\\n    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has\\n       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of\\n       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks\\n       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.\\n    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig\\n       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative\\n       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new\\n       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) \\n       manual page for more information on the format of this file).\\n\\n       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file\\n       in the source distribution for full details.\\n\\n   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the\\n   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.\\n\\n4. What OSs are supported?\\n\\n    XFree86 supports:\\n\\tSVR4.2: Consensys V4.2\\n\\tSVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC\\n\\tSVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2\\n\\tLinux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1\\n\\n\\tBSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active\\n\\tBSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.\\n\\n\\tNote that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,\\n\\tbut anyone should feel free to submit patches.\\n\\tIf you are interested in tackling this, send mail to\\n\\txfree86@physics.su.oz.au\\n\\n5. What video hardware is supported?\\n\\n   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:\\n\\n\\tTseng ET4000\\n\\tTseng ET3000\\n\\tParadise PVGA1\\n\\tWestern Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of\\n\\t\\tthe PVGA1, and use its driver)\\n\\tGenoa GVGA\\n\\tTrident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000\\n\\tATI 18800, 28800\\n\\n\\tAll of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,\\n\\twith the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in\\n\\t256 color mode.\\n\\n\\tThe monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of\\n\\tvideo memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the\\n\\tET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome\\n\\tserver, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.\\n\\n\\tIt appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to\\n\\tnon-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To\\n\\tavoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86\\n\\t1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel\\n\\tclock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are\\n\\tdiscovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how\\n\\tthese programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such\\n\\ta program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with\\n\\tfuture XFree86 releases.\\n\\n\\tIf you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,\\n\\tit is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the\\n\\tOrchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not\\n\\twork with them, because Diamond won\\'t provide programming details.\\n\\tIn fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond\\n\\tproducts, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions\\n\\tof code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).\\n\\tIf you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.\\n\\n\\tSome people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA\\n\\tvideo cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the\\n\\tCPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It\\n\\tcould be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset\\n\\ton the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don\\'t have a lot\\n\\tof access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested\\n\\ttheory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not\\n\\tworking on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86\\n\\tworking fine on them.\\n\\n6. What about accelerated boards?\\n\\n\\tAt this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards\\n\\tlike the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available\\n\\tin commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).\\n\\n\\tAn S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact\\n\\t<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.\\n\\n\\tA beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>\\n\\tor <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.\\n\\n7. Why doesn\\'t XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?\\n\\n\\tThe reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the\\n\\t16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory\\n\\tcontains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-\\n\\tplanes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each\\n\\tof each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-\\n\\tbuffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled\\n\\t16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code\\n\\tcould be modified to support this (or it already may; I\\'m not sure).\\n\\tBut for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer\\n\\timplementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,\\n\\tbut nothing is yet available from the project.\\n\\n8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?\\n\\n\\tObviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run\\n\\tX efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.\\n\\tThe various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending\\n\\ton the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).\\n\\tTo build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will\\n\\tbe required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable \\n\\tlower bound.\\n\\n9. Where can I get source for XFree86?\\n\\n\\tSource patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22\\n\\tfrom MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:\\n\\t\\texport.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)\\n\\t\\tftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)\\n\\t\\tftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)\\n\\t(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)\\n\\n\\tRefer to the README file under the specified directory for information\\n\\ton which files you need to get to build your distribution.\\n\\n10.

Each binary distribution will\\n\\tcontain a README file that describes what files you need to take\\n\\tfrom the archive, and which compile-time option selections were\\n\\tmade when building the distribution.\\n\\nIV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?\\n\\n11. Installation directories\\n\\n\\tThe top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot\\n\\t(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include\\n\\tfiles, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.\\n\\n\\tThis can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified\\n\\tvia symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is\\n\\tnonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed\\n\\talongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.\\n\\n12. Configuration files\\n\\n\\tThe XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\"Xconfig\") on startup.\\n\\tThe search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in\\n\\tthe server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.\\n\\n13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes\\n\\n\\tDavid E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known\\n\\tclock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.\\n\\tThe database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and\\n\\tis in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is\\n\\talso available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on\\n\\texport.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated\\n\\toccasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the\\n\\tsettings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to\\n\\tDavid for inclusion in the database.\\n\\n\\tIf this doesn\\'t help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file \\n\\twith XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.\\n\\tIt may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use\\n\\tthis description to get them right.  When you do, send the information\\n\\tto David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.\\n\\n\\tNOTE: The old \\'clock.exe\\' program is not supported any more, and\\n\\t      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot\\n\\t      clock values for a new board, remove the \\'Clocks\\' line from\\n\\t      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The\\n\\t      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.\\n\\t      You can use these values to put a \\'Clocks\\' line into your\\n\\t      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up\\n\\t      starting the server in the future.\\n\\n14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit\\n\\n\\tIf you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to\\n\\treconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is\\n\\tfully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.\\n\\nV) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?\\n\\n\\tFirst of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).\\n\\n15. SVR4\\n\\tWhy won\\'t my xterm run properly?\\n\\n\\tIf your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define\\n\\tCONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won\\'t run.\\n\\tcsh users should use \\'setenv CONSEM no\\'\\n\\n\\tThe Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping\\n\\tproblems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be\\n\\tinstalled.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.\\n\\n16. SVR3\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that\\'s what you are running.\\n\\n17. 386BSD\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.\\n\\n\\tAlso, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey\\n\\t<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the\\n\\tfile XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:\\n\\n\\t    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\t    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\t    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\n18. Linux\\n\\n\\tYou must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc\\n\\tjump libraries installed.\\n\\n\\tMake sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.\\n\\n\\tIf your kernel doesn\\'t have TCP support compiled in, you\\'ll have to\\n\\trun the server as \"X -pn\". The default startup configuration assumes\\n\\tthat TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files\\n\\t/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the\\n\\t-pn argument to X386.\\n\\n\\tMake sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major\\n\\tnumber 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not\\n\\towned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit\\n\\tconsole output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but\\n\\tstartx won\\'t.\\n\\n\\tWhen running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with\\n\\ta tty, for example \"xdm < /dev/console &\".\\n\\n\\tFor more detailed information, please read the file README present\\n\\twith the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.\\n\\n19. Mach\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.\\n\\nVI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?\\n\\n\\tThis section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is\\n\\tfully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.\\n\\tPlease look at those files for information on building XFree86.\\n\\nVII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?\\n\\n20. BSD compatibility library\\n\\n\\tA lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.\\n\\tThe default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a\\n\\twhich contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),\\n\\tseed(). A better way of providing the \\'b\\' functions is to include\\n\\t<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro\\n\\tdefinitions for these in terms of the SYSV \\'mem\\' functions.  If you are\\n\\tlinking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these\\n\\tfunctions, then you should link with libXbsd.a\\n\\n21. ANSICCOPTIONS\\n\\n\\tThis is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the\\n\\tANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite\\n\\tthe entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you\\'d see\\n\\tsomething like\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tand to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tin his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of\\n\\t\\tANSICCOPTIONS=\"-ansi\"\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tand all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:\\n\\t\\tANSICCOPTIONS=\\n\\tto get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death\\n\\twith -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because\\n\\tCCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must\\n\\tadd \\'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)\\' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.\\n\\nXFree86 Contact Information\\n\\n    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86\\n    Core Team.

       " '\\n\\nThe argument for Luke\\'s genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According\\nto Luke 3:23\\n\\n   And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about \\n   thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,\\n   the son of Eli,\\n\\nAside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible\\ninterpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother.\\nClearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son\\nof Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man\\nto whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at\\nstraws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no\\nintention of tracing Mary\\'s genealogy (in which case he would have\\nnamed her) but that he traces her husband\\'s, from David\\'s son Nathan.\\n\\nThe Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David\\'s\\nson, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:\\n\\n   And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born\\n   Jesus, who is called Christ. \\n\\nThere are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the\\ntwo paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David,\\nSolomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph\\nrelavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was\\nnot Jesus\\'s physical father, then the original poster is quite\\ncorrect, that claims for Jesus\\'s messianic heritage are not based on\\ntruth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus\\'s divine nature was.\\n\\nThe second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not\\ninvolved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy\\nSpirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also\\ncapable of employing the physical agency of Joseph\\'s seed in this\\nwork.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss\\nsolely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of\\npurity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that\\nneither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they\\nhad not \"known\"each other).  Thus the first gospel\\'s dedication of\\nhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant\\nto Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.\\n\\nTo the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more\\nproblems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating \\nthe births of two entirely different children of two entirely different\\nsets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and \\nthe birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two \\nstories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years\\nlater with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his\\nexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge\\nwith their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his\\nresolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external\\ndocuments, and the discussion of \"how this could be\" might bring us beyond\\nthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the\\ndetails are described in Steiner\\'s \"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human \\nBeing and of Humanity\", \"The Gospel of St. Luke\", and \"The Gospel of St.\\nMatthew\". \\n\\nWhether or not Rudolf Steiner\\'s methods and explanation are accepted\\nas valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent\\ncontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.\\n\\nAs for the passing of one\\'s Jewishness through the mother, this was\\nnever an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary\\'s\\nJewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal\\nline of descent from David, the king.',\n",

       " '\\nI am not an expert in the cryptography science, but some basic things\\nseem evident to me, things which this Clinton Clipper do not address.\\nThe all pertain to opportunites for abuse, and conclusions based on what\\nI have seen the membership of this group (except for two notable persons)\\nagree to.  If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it\\nalmost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse\\nIMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.\\n\\nI think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be\\nexpanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored\\ndata. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such\\nexpansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident).\\nThere was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please\\nbear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say\\nwhat others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.\\n\\n\\nAs I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or\\nsimilar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions\\nsuch as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how\\nthis thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat\\nthis in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other\\nareas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if\\nthis proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in\\nseveral other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not\\ngoing to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop\\nwhenever they want to.  \\'Court order required\\' has proven to be a rather\\nflimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the\\nmaterial, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on\\nperiodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice\\nsystem the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty\\n(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not\\nprotected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would\\nresult in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions\\non private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it\\ndoes make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially\\nfishing expeditions without the target\\'s knowlege.  Don\\'t give up the\\nright to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton\\nand Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,\\nfiguring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come\\nthose consulted could be roughly described as \"us insiders\"?  They cannot\\nquietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its\\nexclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.\\nDon\\'t buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,\\npast or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest\\nand the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not \\'unlikely\\'\\nor \\'difficult\\'.\\n\\n\\nSo what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved\\nafter the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,\\neasily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,\\nwould authorize a tap which wouldn\\'t have been possible otherwise.  This\\nhas been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For\\nlocal cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds\\nhave a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe\\nfor example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen\\nin on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or\\nvia a \\'master key\\'?  I sure don\\'t.\\n\\nThis whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use\\nold-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping\\nwas rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law\\nEnforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes\\nthat require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I\\njust find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much\\nabout civil and individual rights, that \"puts people first\".  The question\\nis \"put people first\" to WHERE?\\n\\nWith the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN\\'T\\nexist a \\'master key\\' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword\\nscan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific\\ncourt order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.\\nBet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that\\nthey have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to\\nkeep them from simply keeping the keys on file for \\'next time\\'? After\\nawhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks\\nthey deem \\'disruptive\\'.  And if they get only one key, that would\\nreduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember\\nNixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn\\'t it?\\n\\nAnd unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!\\nI see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice\\n:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to\\na competitor\\'s Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded\\nto be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get\\none the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important\\nconcern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...\\n\\n\\nWhat will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You\\ncan BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.\\nIt is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the\\nargumet \"well, if you got nothing to hide...\"  Fine. Then using that\\nargument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in\\nevery room of one\\'s home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but\\nthe principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a\\ngovt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as\\nto \\'safeguards\\'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are\\npretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.\\n\\nDon\\'t work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish\\nbad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.\\n\\n\\nPeople would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years,\\nbecause we have this \\'crisis\\' situation which MUST be addressed by some\\n\\'drastic action\\', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother\\nthose who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don\\'t buy into it.\\n\\nIf the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public\\nso many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few\\nisolated \\'respected experts\\' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a\\ncertain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected\\nexperts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was\\nadvocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the\\nexperts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper\\nChip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled\\nversion (with a \\'master key\\' provision), or features not present in the\\nversion subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who\\nchooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there...\\n:-)\\n\\nAnd isn\\'t it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT\\nhave its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known?\\nI was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything\\nyou have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this\\ngroup are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...\\n\\nAnother question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not\\nbe used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure\\nbut \"good enough\" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full\\ndescription (not a PR non-statement) of just what \"good enough\" means?\\nI think when saying how strong it is, \"good enough\" really means \"not\\nvery\".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not\\nacceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and\\nConstitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other\\ncountries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as\\nrevokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and\\nprotections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA\\nhave this thing to \\'fight crime\\'.  We have allready have our Bill of\\nRights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining\\nfor yet another \\'noble cause\\', instead we should be trying to repair\\nthe damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \"too\\nmany rights and safeguards\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court\\nsystem and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having\\n\"too many rights\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,\\netc).\\n\\nBTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe\\nthis:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed\\nthis thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights\\nunder the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades\\nhave been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the\\nConstitution.  It has to stop.  Now is as good a time as any, if it\\nisn\\'t too late allready.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

There are many other differences between men and women which\\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\\n\\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \\nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\\n\\n\\nThere is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is\\ntaken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and\\nfemale Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from\\nearly Islamic history is the Prophet\\'s widow, Aisha, who was recognized\\nin her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.\\n\\n\\nYou have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and\\nI dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I\\nrecently reposted something here under the heading \"Islam and Women\" --\\nif it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted\\nfrom soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it\\nstill might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title\\nwas though).  I will email it to you if you like. \\n\\n\\nYour statement that \"other religions are no different\" is, I think, a\\nstatement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than\\nChristianity and perhaps Judaism.\\n\\n\\nAisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also\\nwas, at one stage, a military leader.\\n\\n\\nThe Prophet\\'s first wife, who died just before the \"Hijra\" (the\\nProphet\\'s journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.\\n\\nLucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your\\nviewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.',\n",

       " '\\nThe third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than\\nApple\\'s. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire\\n(BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240\\nall have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly\\nremembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all\\nof them are going to be Thinwire.

Going\\n    for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which\\n    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.\\n    As for Thicknet, it\\'s a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it\\n    unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).\\n\\n(2) On the Mac side, you will need:\\n    - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).\\n    - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won\\'t run on System 7.1).\\n    - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be\\n      getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don\\'t use earlier versions on a Centris).\\n    - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the\\n      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is\\n      self-terminated or not.\\n    - configure MacTCP to use \"Ethernet\".\\n\\n(3) On the DECstation side, you will need:\\n    - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.\\n    - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.\\n      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the\\n      DECstation.

       " '\\n[...]\\n\\n   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION\\n   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What\\n   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.\\n\\n   [Reproduced without permission]\\n\\n\\t   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,\\n\\twhere a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under\\n\\tthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,\\n\\tpresumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if\\n\\ta person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group\\n\\tof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and\\n\\tsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after\\n\\tdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage.\\n\\t   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a\\n\\tgood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.\\n\\tHowever, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers\\n\\tdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did\\n\\tactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not\\n\\tnecessarily go hand in hand.\\n\\t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining\\n\\tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.\\n\\tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of the\\n\\tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins\\n\\tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-\\n\\tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in\\n\\tthe amount of food eaten afterward.\\n\\n\\t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing\\n\\tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a\\n\\thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government\\n\\thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing\\n\\teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.\\n\\tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and\\n\\tafter the sweetener\\'s entering the market have failed to confirm\\n\\tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That\\'s why the\\n\\tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged with\\n\\tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association\\'s\\n\\tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration\\n\\thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a\\n\\tclean bill of health.\\n\\t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an \"acceptable daily intake\" of\\n\\t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed\\n\\tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take\\n\\tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of\\n\\taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,\\n\\tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...\\n\\tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams\\n\\tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups\\n\\tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content\\n\\tof selected foods omitted]\\n\\t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away\\n\\tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called\\n\\tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000\\n\\tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential\\n\\tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child\\n\\tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause\\n\\tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with\\n\\tPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other\\n\\taspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \"Phenylketonurics:\\n\\tContains Phenylalanine.\"\\n',\n",

Let me explain.\\n\\n\\tRemember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail\\nbuffer can claim they are \"too young\" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet.\\nThe eighties were about \"How America Learned to Win Once Again\". Then\\n(wouldn\\'t you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win.\\nNo Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer\\n(We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no\\nholds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a\\nfew \"little\" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an\\nS&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to\\ncontend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya\\', the God Augustus never had\\nit so good. \\n\\n\\tIn the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one\\ndoesn\\'t deserve one\\'s bounty - or success. So there is a \"kinder and gentler\\ntype of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of\\ndiscourse about people who \"don\\'t get it\". For those of us in the winning\\nbusiness, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no \\nsuggestion of losing.\\n\\n\\tBut what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our \\n\"white male\" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out \\nphotojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one\\nwith a \"Hail Mary\" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind \\'three\\nyards and a cloud of dust\\' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses\\nin the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the \\nweapon of choice these days. \\n\\t\\n\\tWho is D-FENS, anyway ?

But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt \\nsure does look natural on Mike doesn\\'t it. Gordon Gekko will never look the \\nsame. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to \\ntake it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?\\n\\n\\tWhat we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is \\nthe same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood\\nused to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott\\ndeclaimed, \"Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will \\nnot tolerate a loser.\" And so on. \\n\\n\\tThe political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and\\nDemocrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some \\n\"equitable\" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a \\nloser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian\\nhomosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined\\nday when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) \\nminority.\\n\\n\\tOr you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most\\nconservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn\\'t care\\nwho\\'s winning and who\\'s losing.
